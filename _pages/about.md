My name is Nathaniel Bannister and I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. My research interests are primarily in pure set theory and most of my past research has been studying the derived functors of the inverse limit, particularly on whether these functors are additive, and the connections with a homology theory known as strong homology.

I received a BA in math from Cornell University in 2021.
